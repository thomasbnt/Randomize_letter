```javascript
function Load() {
    let l = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    const out = l.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * l.length)) // Randomize !
    document.getElementById('random').textContent = out // Get ID 'random' for edit the text context
    document.title = out // Edit the title of page
}
```
